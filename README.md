Took work from A16 gamestages.xml to A18: https://7daystodie.com/forums/showthread.php?68457-Quick-fix-to-quot-boring-blood-moons-quot

Thanks to Guppycur for creating this.

At the time of creating this, the changes are untested in A18.

To be clear, I just A/B compared the A16 gamestages.xml file from Guppycur's pastebin to the current A18 gamestages.xml file.

I updated 321 lines by hand (copy/paste), adding in the "<spawn group="ZombiesNight" num="xxx" maxAlive="yy"/></gamestage>" updates to each line from the original file.

There could be more changes than that, but this is what is here as of 11/4/2019. :)
